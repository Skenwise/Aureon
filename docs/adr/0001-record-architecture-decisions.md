# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2026-01-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made for this project.
ADRs are a lightweight way to document these decisions, the reasons behind them, and their consequences.

## Decision

We will use Markdown files in the `docs/adr` directory to record architectural decisions.
Each ADR will have a filename in the format `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`, where `NNNN` is a sequence number.
Each ADR will contain the following sections:

*   **Title**: A short, descriptive title.
*   **Date**: The date the decision was made.
*   **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded.
*   **Context**: The context and problem that this decision addresses.
*   **Decision**: The decision that was made.
*   **Consequences**: The consequences of this decision, both positive and negative.

## Consequences

This will create a clear record of our architectural decisions, which will help new developers understand the project's history and rationale.
It will also help us to avoid repeating past mistakes.
The process of writing an ADR will force us to think through our decisions more carefully.
We will need to be disciplined about creating and maintaining these records.
